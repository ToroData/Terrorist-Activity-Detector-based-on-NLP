# Project Description
This project is a terrorist activity detection system based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) designed to identify and prevent potential terrorist threats in texts, messages, and online articles. The project has been developed with the aim of strengthening national security and protecting citizens.

# Operation
The system utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze text content for clues or patterns associated with terrorist activities. The detection process is entirely automatic and occurs in real-time.

# Ethics and Responsibility
The primary objective is to prevent potential terrorist threats and safeguard public safety without compromising individual rights and freedoms. Safeguards have been implemented to prevent unfair discrimination or the violation of user privacy.

# Responsible Usage
It should be employed responsibly within the context of national security and counterterrorism efforts.

# Technical Requirements
- Python 3.9

# Usage Instructions
To use the detector, you can run the Python notebook. From there, you will obtain the model that you can subsequently deploy in desired systems. For example, you can implement Lambda functions to prevent the publication of messages that do not pass the filter and send these messages to the legal department of the social network.
